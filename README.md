## Project Requirements 

### Project Description:

**Who is it for?**

People who need extra external motivation to complete their tasks

**What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)**

* Be able to track tasks to complete
* Be able to see what tasks other people are working on
* Be able to give and receive support for working on tasks
* Earn currency by completing tasks and spend them to ‘cheer’ on others to complete tasks or spend in store

**What type of data will it store?**
* Tasks to complete (text)
* Avatars (images)
* Journaling (text, number rating)
* Point System/Claps (number)
* Metadata 

**What will users be able to do with this data?**

Look at it to help live their lives fruitfully

**What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?**
* In app currency
* Score system

### Project task requirements

**3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)**
```
- To be able to add/complete tasks
- Currency system (donating “bits” to tasks, so that the person gets these “bits” upon task completion)
- Global “task feed” curated from other users
```


**3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)**
```
- Edit and delete tasks
- Subtasks and progress based on these
- Login and signup system
- User profile
- Friend System - new feeds with just (all) friends’ tasks (huge in scope, so keep note when creating normal feed, so it can be extended)
- Have your tasks there after you sign in again
- Statistics (how many tasks you’ve done in a week/month, tracking your bit gain (get to do cool graph stuff))
```

**2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!)**
```
- In app notification (friends’ tasks, etc)
- Store (to create incentivize obtaining of bits)
- Ads (watch ads to get bits? Room of ads where you afk and get bits)
- Email notification reminder to complete your tasks
- Create our own API
```

### 2 of our minimal requirements broken down

**Design main UI for task creation**
* Saving and storing tasks on DB
* Progress (and subtask) tracking system
* Time
* Fetching bits and aggregating reward

**Task Feed**
* Global feed population from DB
* Design global feed UI (including claps, comments, and bits)
* Data design for claps and bits and saving these in each task
