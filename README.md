## Project Requirements 

### Project Description:
Do more together with DoGether!

DoGether is a social task management app that helps users motivate users.

Using DoGether, you can create Tasks, browse others' Tasks, and support each other by giving a currency of "Mangos"; Extra motivation comes in the form of achievements, and even a store to spend hard-earned Mangos.

### 2 of our minimal requirements broken down

**Design main UI for task creation**
* Saving and storing tasks on DB
* Progress (and subtask) tracking system
* Time
* Fetching bits and aggregating reward

**Task Feed**
* Global feed population from DB
* Design global feed UI (including claps, comments, and bits)
* Data design for claps and bits and saving these in each task
